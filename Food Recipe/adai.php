    <ul>
      <li>   
      1 cup raw rice

1/4 cup chana dal (split chickpeas)
1/4 cup toor dal (split pigeon peas)

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <div><p>
Instructions:
Soaking:

Wash the raw rice, parboiled rice, chana dal, toor dal, urad dal, and moong dal together.
Soak them in water for 3-4 hours.
Grinding:

After soaking, drain the water and grind the soaked ingredients along with dry red chilies, asafoetida, cumin seeds, and grated ginger to a coarse batter. Add water as needed while grinding.
Batter Consistency:

The batter should be thicker than dosa batter but not as thick as idli batter. It should have a coarse texture.
Add Salt:

Transfer the batter to a bowl and add salt. Mix well.
Prepare Adai:

Heat a griddle or a non-stick pan.
Take a ladle full of batter and spread it on the hot griddle to form a pancake. You can make it as thick or thin as you prefer.
Cooking:

Drizzle a little oil around the edges of the adai and in the center. Cook on medium heat until the edges start to brown.
Flip and Cook:

Flip the adai and cook the other side until it's cooked through and has a golden-brown color.
Serve:

Repeat the process with the remaining batter.
Serve the hot Adai with avial and coconut chutney.
Serving Suggestions:
Adai is often served with avial, a mixed vegetable curry made with coconut and yogurt, along with coconut chutney. It makes for a wholesome and satisfying meal. You can customize the recipe by adding finely chopped onions, curry leaves, or other ingredients of your choice to the batter before cooking.
