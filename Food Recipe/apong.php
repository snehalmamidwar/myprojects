    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div><p>For the apong:</p></div>
    <ul>
      <li>  1 cup sticky rice
1 cup regular rice
Water
1 tablespoon yeast (or traditional starter culture, if available)
1-2 tablespoons sugar (optional, for sweetness)
Banana leaves (for covering, if available)
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="method">
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <div><p>
    Rinse the Rice:

Wash both the sticky rice and regular rice thoroughly.
Soak the Rice:

Soak the rice in water for around 6-8 hours or overnight.
Grind the Rice:

Drain the soaked rice and grind it into a coarse paste. You can use a traditional stone grinder or a mixer grinder.
Fermentation:

Transfer the ground rice paste to a clean, large container.
Add water to the paste to create a thick batter-like consistency.
Add the yeast (or traditional starter culture) to the mixture and mix well.
Cover the container with a clean cloth and let it ferment in a warm place for about 24-48 hours. The fermentation time may vary based on the ambient temperature.
Strain:

After fermentation, strain the mixture using a clean cloth or a sieve to remove the solid residue. The liquid obtained is your Apong.
Sweetening (Optional):

If you prefer a slightly sweet taste, you can add sugar to the Apong and mix well.
Storage:

Transfer the Apong to clean bottles or containers for storage.
Maturation:

Allow the Apong to mature for an additional 24-48 hours. This step enhances the flavor.
Serving:

Apong is traditionally served at room temperature. You can chill it if you prefer a colder beverage.
Traditional Covering (Optional):

If you have banana leaves, you can cover the container with them during fermentation. This is believed to add a distinct flavor to the Apong.
Remember that the fermentation time and the flavor of Apong may vary based on factors like temperature and the yeast used. Exercise caution and ensure cleanliness throughout the process to prevent contamination.

Enjoy your homemade Apong responsibly! Note that the consumption of traditional rice beer should be done in moderation, and it's important to be aware of local regulations regarding the production and consumption of such beverages.
