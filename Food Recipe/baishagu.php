    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div><p>For the Bodo:</p></div>
    <ul>
      <li>For the Batter:
2 cups rice flour
1 cup grated coconut
1 cup jaggery (grated or powdered)
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
Water (as needed for batter consistency)
A pinch of salt
For Frying:
Mustard oil or any cooking oil of your choice</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="method">
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <div><p>

    1. Prepare the Batter:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the rice flour, grated coconut, jaggery, baking soda, and a pinch of salt.
Gradually add water and mix well to form a smooth, lump-free batter. The consistency should be like a pancake batter.
2. Heat the Griddle:

Heat a griddle or a non-stick pan on medium heat.
3. Make the Zou:

Grease the griddle with a little oil.
Pour a ladleful of the batter onto the griddle and spread it evenly to form a thin pancake.
4. Cook:

Cook the Zou on medium heat until bubbles form on the surface and the edges start to lift.
5. Flip and Cook:

Flip the Zou and cook the other side until it turns golden brown.
6. Repeat:

Repeat the process with the remaining batter to make more Zou.
7. Serve:

Serve the Bodo Zou warm. It can be enjoyed as is or with a side of yogurt or chutney.
Bodo Zou is a sweet pancake with the natural sweetness coming from jaggery and the rich flavor from grated coconut. It's a traditional dish often made during festivals and special occasions in the Bodo community.

Please note that this is a basic recipe, and variations may exist within Bodo households. Additionally, Bodo cuisine includes a variety of other dishes, and the choice of ingredients may vary based on personal preferences and regional differences.
