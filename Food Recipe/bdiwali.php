Hang the chenna for about 1 hour to drain excess water.
Knead the chenna until it becomes smooth and soft.
Make small balls from the kneaded chenna.
In a separate pot, mix sugar and water and bring it to a boil. Add cardamom powder if desired.
Add the chenna balls to the boiling sugar syrup and cover the pot. Cook for 15-20 minutes.
Let them cool and refrigerate before serving.

Instructions for sandesh: 

Knead the paneer until smooth.
Add powdered sugar and cardamom powder to the paneer and mix well.
Cook the mixture on low heat until it thickens and leaves the sides of the pan.
Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
Shape the mixture into small, flat discs or any desired shape.
Garnish with saffron strands if desired.
Allow it to cool completely before serving.
Channar Jalebi Instructions:

Knead the paneer until it becomes smooth.
Add all-purpose flour and baking powder to the paneer and mix well.
Heat ghee in a pan for frying.
Shape the paneer mixture into jalebi-like spirals using a piping bag or a cloth with a small hole.
Fry the jalebis in the hot ghee until they turn golden brown.
Remove excess ghee by placing the jalebis on absorbent paper.
