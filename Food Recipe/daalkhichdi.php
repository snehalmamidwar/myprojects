    <h2>Method</h2>
    <div><p>Step 1:</p></div>
    <p>Wash the rice and lentils together under running water until the water runs clear. Place the washed rice and lentils in a bowl and cover them with water. Allow them to soak for 30 minutes. This helps in cooking them evenly and reduces the cooking time.</p>
    
    <div><p>Step 2:</p></div>
    <p>In a large saucepan or pressure cooker, heat 2 tbsp of ghee or oil over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and allow them to splutter. Add the minced ginger and garlic, and saut√© for a minute until they become fragrant. If using onions, add them now and saut√© until they turn translucent. Add the chopped tomatoes (if using) and cook until they become soft and mushy. Add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Stir well to combine the spices with the other ingredients. Drain the soaked rice and lentils and add them to the pan. Stir them for a couple of minutes to coat them with the spices and ghee/oil.</p>
    
    <div><p>Step 3:</p></div>
    <p>While the khichdi is cooking, prepare the tadka (tempering). Heat 2 tbsp of ghee or oil in a small pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Then, add minced garlic and dried red chilies (if using) and saut√© until the garlic turns golden. Add a pinch of asafoetida and turn off the heat. Once the khichdi is cooked and has a porridge-like consistency, turn off the heat. Pour the prepared tadka over the khichdi and mix well. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves if desired and serve hot. Daal Khichdi is often served with yogurt, pickle, or papad on the side.</p>
