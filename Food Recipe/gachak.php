    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div><p>   
    
    1 cup sesame seeds
1 cup jaggery, grated
2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
A pinch of salt (optional)
</p>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="method">
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <div><p> Dry Roast Sesame Seeds:

In a pan, dry roast the sesame seeds over medium heat until they become golden brown and release a nutty aroma. Keep stirring to ensure even roasting.
Prepare Jaggery Syrup:

In a separate pan, add grated jaggery and a little water.
Heat the jaggery over medium heat until it melts and forms a syrup. Stir continuously to prevent burning.
Check Jaggery Syrup Consistency:

To check the consistency of the jaggery syrup, drop a small amount into a bowl of water. It should form a hard ball.
Combine Sesame Seeds with Jaggery Syrup:

Once the jaggery syrup reaches the desired consistency, add the roasted sesame seeds to the syrup.
Mix well to coat the sesame seeds evenly with the jaggery syrup.
Add Ghee and Cardamom Powder:

Add ghee and cardamom powder to the sesame and jaggery mixture. Mix thoroughly.
Set the Mixture:

Transfer the mixture to a greased plate or a surface lined with parchment paper.
Quickly spread and flatten the mixture using a greased rolling pin or spatula.
Cut into Pieces:

While the mixture is still warm, cut it into desired shapes or squares using a knife.
Let it Cool:

Allow the Ghachak to cool completely and harden.
Serve:

Once completely cooled and hardened, break the Ghachak along the cut lines.
Serve the crispy Ghachak as a sweet treat during festivals or special occasions.
Enjoy the delightful crunch and sweetness of Himachali Ghachak. Adjust the sweetness according to your taste preferences and feel free to add chopped nuts for extra texture and flavor if desired.
