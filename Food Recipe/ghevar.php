      <li>   
For the Batter:

2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)
1/2 cup ghee (clarified butter), melted
1/2 cup chilled milk
1/2 cup ice-cold water
For Sugar Syrup:

2 cups sugar
1 cup water
A pinch of saffron strands (optional)
1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder

Chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios) for garnish
Ghee for deep frying



</ul>

    <div><p>

Instructions:
Prepare the Batter:

In a large mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour and melted ghee.
Gradually add chilled milk while continuously stirring to avoid lumps.
Slowly add ice-cold water and mix until you get a smooth, lump-free batter with a pouring consistency.
Fry the Ghevar:

Heat ghee in a wide, heavy-bottomed pan. Make sure the ghee is not too hot.
Pour a ladleful of batter through the hole in the center of the pan, allowing it to spread and form a circular shape.
Fry until the edges become crispy and golden. Ghevar should have a porous and lacy structure.
Remove from Ghee:

Once fried, carefully lift the Ghevar from the ghee, allowing excess ghee to drain off.
Prepare Sugar Syrup:

In a separate pan, combine sugar and water to make a sugar syrup.
Add saffron strands (if using) and cardamom powder. Boil until it reaches a one-string consistency.
Soak the Ghevar:

Immerse the fried Ghevar in the warm sugar syrup for a few seconds. Allow it to soak in the syrup, ensuring it is well-coated.
Garnish:

Place the soaked Ghevar on a plate and garnish with chopped nuts.
Serve:

Ghevar is best served at room temperature. As it cools, the sugar syrup crystallizes, giving it a delightful texture.
Enjoy the rich and festive flavors of Ghevar, a dessert that beautifully captures the essence of Rajasthani cuisine.
