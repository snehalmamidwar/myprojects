    <h1>UkadicheModak</h1>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <div class="desc"><p>"Ukadiche" literally means steamed. Ukadiche Modak is similar to dumplings, with an outer layer of steamed rice flour dough and a sweet filling of fresh coconut and jaggery. After shaping and filling the dumplings they are then steamed which gives them a soft melt-in-the-mouth texture.</p></div>
