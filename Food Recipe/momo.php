    <h2>Method</h2>
    <div><p>

    For Dumpling Filling:
Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat.
Add minced garlic and saut√© until aromatic.
Add chopped spring onions and saut√© for a minute.
Add all the chopped vegetables and stir-fry until they are cooked but still slightly crunchy.
Add soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix well and cook for another minute.
Allow the filling to cool completely.
For Dumpling Dough:
In a large bowl, mix the all-purpose flour and a pinch of salt.
Gradually add water and knead the flour to form a smooth, elastic dough. The consistency should be similar to that of bread dough.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
Assembling and Cooking Dumplings:
Divide the dough into small, equal-sized portions.
Roll each portion into a thin, round disc (about 3 inches in diameter).
Place a spoonful of the vegetable filling in the center of the disc.
Fold the edges of the disc to form a half-moon shape and seal the edges by pinching them together.
Continue this process until all the dumplings are prepared.
Cooking Dumplings:
Steam the dumplings in a steamer for about 15-20 minutes or until the dumplings are cooked through.
