    <h4>Description</h4>
    <div class="desc"><p>Narali Bhat is a traditional Maharashtrian dish served for Narali Poornima, a festival that marks the end of the monsoon season. Most festival dishes aren't as easy to make as Narali Bhat. This dish can be made in only 15 minutes, simply by adding ingredients to the Instant Pot and letting it cook.</p></div>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    
    <p>We need less cooked rice for making coconut bhat. The rice can be prepared in microwave or over flame. Wash the rice thoroughly and soak them in water for half an hour. Drain out the water from rice after half an hour is over.

Take a microwave safe bowl for cooking rice in microwave. Add 2 tsp ghee in the bowl and microwave it for 1 minute. Take out the bowl and add cinnamon and 4 cloves into it and microwave for another 1 minute.

Take out the bowl again and place the rice into it, followed with 2 cups of water. Cover the bowl, leaving it slightly open and cook for 8 minutes. Chop the dry fruits. Make 6 to 7 pieces of each cashew and thinly slice the almonds. Remove stalk from the raisins and clean. Peel cardamom and powder. 

Take the bowl out after 8 minutes and let them stay as it is for 15 minutes. Rice will be prepared instantly. 
Add 2 to 3 tbsp ghee in a wok and heat sufficiently. When the ghee is heated sufficiently, add almonds, cashews and raisins into it. Also add grated coconut and crushed jaggery as well. Cook until jaggery melts completely. Now add rice and mix all ingredients really well. 

Cover the vessel and cook bhat for 20 minutes on low flame. After cooking, open the lid and add cardamom powder into it. Scrumptious coconut bhat is ready. Garnish with chopped almonds-cashews and raisins. </p>

    <h4>Tips And Tricks: Traditionally, coconut bhat is prepared with jaggery, but you can replace it with sugar as well. 
You can make rice over flame in any vessel. 
Don't cook the rice to much, keep them bit granulated and hard. </h4></div>
