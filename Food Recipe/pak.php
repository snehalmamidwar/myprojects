    <ul>
      <li>   
1 cup besan (chickpea flour)
1 cup ghee
1.5 cups sugar
1/2 cup water
A pinch of cardamom powder
A handful of chopped nuts (optional)

Instructions:
Prepare the Tray:

Grease a tray or plate with ghee and set it aside.
Sift Chickpea Flour:

Sift the besan to ensure there are no lumps.
Make Sugar Syrup:

In a saucepan, combine sugar and water.
Heat the mixture on medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
Allow the sugar syrup to boil until it reaches a one-string consistency. To check this, take a small amount of syrup between your thumb and forefinger. When you pull them apart, a single string should form.
Prepare Besan Mixture:

In a separate heavy-bottomed pan, heat ghee on low flame.
Add the sifted besan to the ghee and stir continuously to avoid lumps. Keep stirring until the besan is well-cooked and releases a pleasant aroma.
Combine Besan and Sugar Syrup:

Slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into the besan mixture while continuously stirring. Be cautious, as the mixture will be hot.
Cook the Mixture:

Continue cooking the mixture on low heat, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
Keep adding ghee little by little as you stir. The mixture will start to thicken.
Add Cardamom Powder:

Once the mixture reaches a consistency where it leaves the sides of the pan and becomes frothy, add a pinch of cardamom powder and mix well.
Transfer to Tray:

Pour the mixture onto the greased tray and spread it evenly.
Cut into Pieces:

Allow it to cool for a few minutes but cut it into pieces while it's still warm. This makes it easier to cut.
Garnish (Optional):

Garnish with chopped nuts if desired.
Cool Completely:

Let the Mysore Pak cool completely before separating the pieces.
Your Mysore Pak is ready to be enjoyed. It has a melt-in-the-mouth texture and a rich, sweet flavor. Store it in an airtight container once it has cooled completely.
