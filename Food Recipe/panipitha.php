    <div><p>

    1. Prepare the Filling:

Dry roast the sesame seeds in a pan until they become golden brown. Allow them to cool.
Grind the roasted sesame seeds to make a coarse powder.
In a bowl, mix the ground sesame seeds, grated jaggery, grated coconut (if using), and cardamom powder. This is your filling.
2. Make the Outer Covering (Pitha Dough):

In a pan, bring water to a boil with a pinch of salt.
Slowly add rice flour to the boiling water while continuously stirring to avoid lumps.
Cook the mixture until it forms a soft dough. Turn off the heat and let it cool slightly.
3. Assemble the Pitha:

Take a small portion of the rice dough and flatten it in your hand to form a small disc.
Place a spoonful of the sesame-jaggery filling in the center of the disc.
Fold the edges of the disc to cover the filling and shape it into a ball or a small oval.
4. Cook the Pitha:

Heat oil or ghee in a pan for frying.
Fry the prepared pithas until they turn golden brown and crispy on the outside.
5. Serve:

Drain excess oil and let the pithas cool slightly before serving.
Tilor Pitha is often enjoyed during festivals like Bihu in Assam. The combination of the nutty sesame filling and the sweet jaggery makes it a delightful treat. Adjust the sweetness according to your preference, and feel free to experiment with variations based on your taste.
