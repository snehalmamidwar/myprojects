    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div><p>For the PantaBha:</p></div>
    <ul>
      <li>   1 cup parboiled rice
Water
Salt to taste
Mustard oil
Green chilies, finely chopped (optional)
Onion, finely chopped (optional)
Coriander leaves, chopped (optional)
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <div><p>

Instructions:
Parboil the Rice:

Wash the rice thoroughly and then parboil it. You want the rice to be partially cooked but still firm.
Cool the Rice:

After parboiling, spread the rice on a flat surface to cool. It's important that the rice is at room temperature before moving on to the next step.
Fermentation:

Place the cooled parboiled rice in a clean, airtight container.
Add water to the rice until it is fully submerged.
Add salt to taste.
Close the container tightly and leave it at room temperature for at least 12-24 hours. This allows the rice to ferment.
Serve:

After the fermentation period, the rice will have a slightly sour taste.
Drain any excess water. The consistency can be adjusted according to your preference; some people prefer it dry, while others prefer it more moist.
Add Flavors (Optional):

Mix in a bit of mustard oil to enhance the flavor.
Add finely chopped green chilies, onions, and coriander leaves for additional taste and texture.
Chill (Optional):

Some people prefer to serve Panta Bhat chilled. You can refrigerate it for a few hours before serving.
Serve with Accompaniments:

Panta Bhat is traditionally served with various side dishes such as fried fish, pickles, green chilies, and sometimes, lentil fritters (known as "bhaja").
Panta Bhat is not only enjoyed for its unique taste but is also a cultural symbol associated with the Bengali New Year festivities. The fermentation process gives it a distinct flavor that adds a special touch to the celebration.
