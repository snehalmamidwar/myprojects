    <ul>
      <li>

    <h2>Method</h2>

Instructions:
Prepare the Ingredients:

Measure out the whole wheat flour, sugar, ghee, and water.
Roast the Flour:

Heat a heavy-bottomed pan or karahi on low to medium heat.
Add the whole wheat flour (atta) and roast it in ghee, continuously stirring to prevent burning.
Roast until the flour turns golden brown, and a rich aroma emanates. This step is crucial for the flavor of Karah Prashad.
Prepare Sugar Syrup:

In a separate pan, combine sugar and water to make a sugar syrup.
Stir well until the sugar dissolves, creating a smooth syrup.
Combine Roasted Flour and Sugar Syrup:

Gradually add the sugar syrup to the roasted flour, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
Keep the heat low to medium to prevent splattering.
Cooking the Prashad:

Continue cooking and stirring until the mixture thickens, and the ghee starts to separate from the mixture. This process takes about 15-20 minutes.
Final Touch:

Once the mixture reaches a halwa-like consistency and the ghee separates, turn off the heat.
The Karah Prashad is now ready.
Serving:

Offer the Karah Prashad in prayer, and then serve it to everyone present.
Tradition:

In Sikh tradition, Karah Prashad is often stirred with a kirpan (a ceremonial sword) while reciting prayers to impart blessings and positive energy.
Note:
The proportion of ingredients can be adjusted based on the desired quantity.
The key to a good Karah Prashad is patience in roasting the flour to achieve the right color and aroma.
The act of preparing and serving Karah Prashad is considered a sacred and respectful practice in Sikhism, emphasizing equality and humility.
Always keep in mind the spiritual significance of Karah Prashad while preparing and sharing this sacred sweet.
