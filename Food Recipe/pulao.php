Instructions:
Prepare Saffron Milk:

Soak saffron strands in warm milk and set aside.
Cook Rice:

In a large pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.
Add soaked and drained basmati rice to the boiling water.
Cook the rice until it's 70-80% done. It should still have a slight bite to it.
Drain the rice and set it aside.
Saut√© Onions and Dry Fruits:

In a heavy-bottomed pan or a biryani pot, heat ghee over medium heat.

Layering and Dum Cooking:

Gently layer the partially cooked rice over the saut√©ed vegetables.
Drizzle the saffron milk over the rice.
Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes. This dum cooking allows the flavors to meld.
Fluff the Rice:

Once done, gently fluff the rice with a fork.
Garnish and Serve:

Serve hot, paired with raita or a side of your choice.
