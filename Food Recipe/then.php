Instructions:
Making the Noodles:
In a large mixing bowl, gradually add water to the all-purpose flour and knead it into a smooth, elastic dough.
Roll the dough into a thin sheet and cut it into flat, irregularly shaped noodles.
Preparing the Soup:
Heat vegetable oil in a large pot. Add minced garlic and grated ginger, saut√© for a minute.
Add sliced onions and cook until translucent.
Add carrots, bell pepper, cabbage, and mushrooms. Stir-fry for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender.
Pour in the vegetable broth and bring it to a simmer.
Add soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. Allow the broth to simmer for about 10-15 minutes until the vegetables are fully cooked.
Cooking the Noodles:
Bring a separate pot of water to boil.
Drop the handmade noodles into the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface (usually just a few minutes).
Drain the noodles and rinse them under cold water.
Assembling the Thentuk:
Add the cooked noodles to the pot of simmering soup.
Allow the noodles to absorb the flavors of the broth for a couple of minutes.
Serving:
Ladle the thentuk into serving bowls, making sure to include a variety of vegetables and noodles.
Garnish with chopped cilantro and green onions.
Serve hot and enjoy your delicious bowl of vegetarian thentuk! Adjust the seasoning according to your taste preferences.
